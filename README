This is some code and a concept outline to verify the randomness of 
SessionIDs in webapplications. Originally written for @stake in 2001, extended
in 2005 by FtR of Phenoelit and van Hauser of THC.org.

Fx of Phenoelit used it some years later in order to check the randomness of 
TAN numbers sent by Citibank for online-banking.
